Material of the [JAXATHON 2025](https://github.com/Diff4Earth/ige-jaxathon-2025) organized at IGE.

The following repository is made of five notebooks separated into two directories:
- data_loading:
	- experimental.ipynb: some experiments, with notes on what worked and what did not,
	- timings.ipynb: produce data loading timings.
- calibration:
	- experimental_results.ipynb: runs calibation on a small subset and plots the loss and the Smagorinsky constant across iterations,
	- timings.ipynb: produce calibration timings,
	- experimental_multi_gpus.ipynb: same as experimental_results.ipynb, but trying to use several GPUs.

See [pastax_calibration.md](https://github.com/Diff4Earth/ige-jaxathon-2025/blob/main/projects/pastax_calibration/pastax_calibration.md) for more details on the objectives and outcomes of the experiments.
